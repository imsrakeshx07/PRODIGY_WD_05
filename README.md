# PRODIGY_WD_05
I'm excited to share my latest project, a weather forecast application built using JavaScript and the OpenWeatherMap API. This project allows users to enter a city name or use their current location to get the latest weather updates, including temperature, wind speed, and humidity. Additionally, it provides a 5-day forecast to help users plan their week ahead. Check it out and let me know what you think! https://imsrakeshx07.github.io/PRODIGY_WD_05/
